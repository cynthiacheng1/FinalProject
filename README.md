Welcome to Simulation of the Shortest Path
We implemented Dijikstra's algorithm to figure out the shortest path between a series of nodes randomly connected.

How to Use:
For a random diagram of nodes run the file ShortestPathNew.java
For the chance to choose the coords of your nodes run the file ShortestPathInput.java
*choose the number of nodes by writing java ShortestPathInput “PLACE INT HERE WITH NO QUOTES” or java ShortestPathInput will run with a default 5 nodes
**note when inputing coordinates (x values have to be between 0 and 540) and (y values have to be between 0 and 340)

Bugs:
Choose four or more nodes in ShortestPathInput
Do not resize the screen
shortestpathalg does not work for all values were unable to write an algorithm which worked for all values , works for some.
